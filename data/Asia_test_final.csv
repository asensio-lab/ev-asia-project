1903, I did not see it. I asked the administrator and it seemed to be removed.

1929, Originally 32A has been adjusted back to 50A

2001, The normal payment of the tram is the same and the administrator does not have any special discounts. 
2006, Its so touching! All four positions are reserved for electric cars today! A miraculous day 
2008, You only need to use the All-in-One Card to charge the card and there is no charge for charging. The charging base of the 346/347 car compartment can reach 48 amperes which is suitable for car users who can reach 11KW and have a short stay time. 344/345 car compartment It s 32 amps which is suitable for riders who will stay here for a long time or riders with a lower charging wattage. 
2010, Full car... 
2011, About 5:30 in the evening at the entrance the administrator told me that the electric parking space of this parking lot is monthly rent. Since the car is mainly coming back for later use it is recommended that we do not go in and use it. I would like to ask whether the electric car parking space in the public parking lot can be used.

2676, It was downgraded to 16A 
2677, Only Tesla cannot get enough Yulon can

2708, Parking fee 50/H 
2709, Four seats two of them are occupied by gasoline cars. I did not expect them to be occupied at all. I will not be able to return to Taipei' Xinyi District. 
2710, You must contact the management room before and after charging to unlock and lock. The 03-3931062 charging gun must be connected first and then the charging pile can be activated with the leisure card. 
2711, Four seats are well charged 
2712, Its actually full 
2713, Go down to B2 and turn left and then left to the right corner. 
2714,Strange. The first charge only gave me a current of 32A. When I tried it again it returned to the last 72A. There were no other vehicles parked nearby I do not know why.

2776, Last year the 72A underground parking lot of Shuinan Economics and Trade 72A has an hourly charging fee of 50. Many people already think it is very expensive. The 32A charge here is about 8-10 hours about 480-600 yuan. I hope that the price can be reduced or there is a full-fill plan.

3088, charging facility was designed for 32A however it can only use 24A due to cable aged.

3378, Equipment power off 
3380, The one near the Taichung Hospital is still malfunctioning and cannot be started 
3381, Currently there are people in both positions. If both of them use 30A they will jump off. Those who are not in a hurry can choose 16A to be more secure.

3385, The charging pile on the right is still malfunctioning

3391, Battery jumped again
3392, Before the manufacturer replaces the power supply equipment it should be noted that the two cars will trip if they exceed 32A. 
3393, There is no way for both. It seems that as long as it is Tesla there is no way to overcharge other electric vehicles. 
3395, I am charging... the first time I am charging

After waiting for a long time I asked the administrator if I could park the charging parking space for charging. He said that there is no seat. I do not want to help me deal with it I asked Say that I want to go out now? He was even more unhappy as if he was going to fight with me and said  Go out if you want to go out.  It was really speechless I couldn' charge me like it was my fault? He was unwilling to help divert the traffic so that the cars were stuck at the gate. Change jobs when you don t want to go to work and vent your emotions there.

6977, Inca International Automobile Industry 
6981, Could not charge 
6984, The Energy Division (066351458) said that parking must have its own charging cable and the policy is not friendly. Tainan City Government said that it wants to develop a low-carbon city. Just talk about it. Compared with the other five capitals it lags far behind.

7049, If there are remarks on the reservation the place will be reserved. 
7050, The line length is very reluctant... You can contact the accommodation first to reserve a place. 
7051, The store s service is very good. If you make a reservation first you will reserve a parking space. If you get 2 parking spaces the charge will be reduced to 20A at the same time. 
7052, There is a petrol truck occupies another seat I hope to put two triangle cones. 
7053, The Tesla charging station was walked away from the petrol station and couldn' get the assistance of the management staff. In such a gorgeous department store they said they had no intention of handling VERY DISAPPOINTING  
7054, They were all stopped by gas trucks! What a pity 
7055, Rotten uncontrolled 
7059, Occupied by a petrol truck it was reported to the guard that it could not be controlled 
7061, The last time I went to the customer service center of the department store to report that it was all occupied they said that Tesla did not pay (electricity?) and they have asked Tesla to dismantle it but they have not come. It means that I do not want to manage it now... 
7062, There is enough or no product to occupy all five oil trucks no one can manage it 
7063, Almost occupied by a petrol truck. The driver saw me and drove back. 
7065, Occupied by petrol cars no triangles and the management office said that there are no trams parked so it cannot provide reservations for the trams. The petrol cars are sued by passengers.

7074, It just happened that a petrol truck just left the seat is really narrow and the petrol truck zzzz next door is also there. 
7075, It is known as the management of a lady' department store but it is a kneeling woman. It is all occupied by ordinary cars and has no management. I suggest that you do not need to come here. 
7077, The parking space is too small and the car next door was parked too close to another car space

7089, Its a great reservation system! Unfortunately it is not exclusively for Tesla. If there are more petrol vehicles it will be given priority to petrol vehicles. 
7090, Its blatant to make an appointment first 
7092, Administration requires appointment 
7093, Make an appointment in advance and the guard will guide you when you arrive. 
7094, Arrived at the scene after the appointment the guards were super good to help and guide and they stopped soon great! 
7096, Convenient charging make an appointment before charging on the plane 
7097, Charging piles need to be reserved in advance in the middle of Building AB. After arriving the guards will guide them into the field and leave the field very intimately. They are very friendly to electric vehicles. 
7098, Intimate service guards clear the way call for appointment in advance! Taichung is really friendly to electric cars 
7099, Nice service I will often come to consume in the future 
7100, Its safer to make an appointment in advance there are Tesla charging stations but ordinary cars can also be parked the guards are super good and help to look after the front and back (Is it because I am a girl afraid that I will hit someone) 
7104, Thank you new world 
7105, B6A area 110V socket on the wall. Ask the management office. It can be used but it is not responsible for follow-up questions. 
7106, Add a Type2 pile 
7108, Type2 now charging 
7109, It s the first time to charge at Tainan Xintiandi! There are a total of six charging cradles! There are no instructions along the way it is the only flaw! The location is on the C-14 and C-24 side! It is the yellow area! PS I was at that time The charging position is 40 amps! 
7113, Its more efficient than the gate of Jingying Hotel and you can deduct parking fees when you eat! 
7116, The two charging locations on the second floor are exclusively for Tesla salespersons. I am going to park and charge the first floor entrance security and ask if I have permission from a Tesla salesperson. Its really XXX more than a petrol car  
7117, Unfortunately there is no J1772 
7118, Three to four of them are used by TESLA itself and TESLA owners can only ask for their own blessings. 
7121, There are reserved parking spaces and the triangular cones move on their own.

7202, There are two parking spaces on the left side of the entrance. There are triangular cones so they are not occupied. They are being charged. It is great! However if the car is filled too late the administrator will open the tanker to stop and it will not be able to charge. .. 
7205, Delta' machine stick 
7206, 32A has a traffic cone. Remember to put it back after charging it! 
7207, no one 
7211, The administrator said that if you cannot charge you can go out immediately and you can be free of charge. Although the charging parking space is only 5 meters away from the management room the administrator has a bad eye and cannot perform management responsibilities and the superiors did not indicate that it needs to be reserved for electric vehicles. 
7213, There are 36 spaces but electric parking spaces are occupied by gasoline vehicles 
7215, Currently Full 
7219, Rotten parking lot. There are 364 remaining parking spaces but the electric parking spaces are occupied. The funny thing is that the heavy-duty locomotive parking spaces have triangle cones but the electric car charging parking spaces are ICED.

7239, Wish they do away with silly check-ins. It does make sense to park on the side first walk over to payment window get checked-in drive into space then charge. That takes good 5 minutes (that is if there's no queue). 
7240, very good 
7245, Good management has fences and triangles 
7246, There is control just swipe the leisure card directly normal charging is in progress 
7247, Please ask the administrator to lower the charging parking barrier first 
7248, Very good the administrator is very kind 
7249, With a ground lock you are not afraid of being occupied by a petrol truck 
7255, It is the job of the parking lot manager to register the utilization rate of electric car parking spaces. It is wrong to ask users to queue up and spend time to register. I spend time registering to calculate my parking fee. Does the Taipei City Government have the slightest subsidy? If it is new In the public parking lot in Beishi the parking fee will be reduced by registering for charging. I am very willing to spend time queuing to register. 
7256, I am so ridiculous that I was asked to register and sign. Gasoline cars occupy electric car parking spaces without registration and electric car charging will waste my time to register. There is no legal source regulation please ignore it. 
7257, I was told that Taipei PMA has ordered all public parking garages to stop reserving parking spaces for electric cars. The reason being low-utilization rate and public complaints (i.e. ICE car drivers cannot find parking spaces). 
7258, Charge until 23:15 
7260, I saw it as soon as I entered the entrance on the second floor 
7261, The uphill in front of the entrance fence is a bit steep 
7264, You can charge!

7281, One swipe card to enter the second floor half of the gate is at the gate 
7282, Both 204 and 205 have rechargeable vehicles in use. There are indeed more rechargeable vehicles near the Neihu Science Park. Internal medicine is a high-tech area and the municipal government should set up more charging facilities in internal medicine. 
7286, Black FIT occupies the charging position 
7287, As soon as the gate of the parking lot comes in the electric parking space is straight in front of you! Super close! There are signs warning cones and spacious parking spaces. Nice

7289, You can start charging by swiping the card with a general leisure card 
7290, Both seats posted notices saying that they are under maintenance 
7291, No control is usually impossible to stop 
7295, Occupied by oil trucks 
7296, Uncontrolled cone Yulon Power Equipment is malfunctioning. 
7297, They are all occupied by petrol trucks. After communicating with the administrator temporarily stop by the side to charge them. 
7298, The petrol truck stopped again.. 
7299, The industry keeps it for electric car owners but they are always parked by petrol cars and cannot be used for charging.

7326, Many holiday cars will first get off B2 and then on B1 to park 
7327, B1 004-007 most of the charging parking spaces are also occupied by ordinary cars

7369, Its the first time to charge  
7370, There is management but the administrator said that if you stop too late there will still be petrol cars unruly and remove the triangle cone. 
7371, Very few people charge the charging guns have spider webs 
7372, Charging is free parking is charged 
7373, The weird one on the left has failed to charge after several attempts but the right is in normal use. 
7374, good 
7375, Good management at the end of B1 downstairs pretty easy to find 
7376, Report here recharge 
7377, The management staff are very enthusiastic to guide the location which is not bad and the correction is now 120 yuan for 10 hours.

Because the car parked in the parking bay on the right is next to the management room you will not be able to get off the car.

7594, The sound insulation effect is very poor. Parents in the parent-child room on the 3rd floor if they have no empathy allow their children to run or lower the volume at will after ten o'clockso they don t have to sleep all night. In addition they can even hear the sound of turning on the faucet. It is clear that the sound insulation really needs to be strengthened. I choose to come on weekdays. It is nothing more than a holiday of better quality. I did not relax to the point that I was noisy all night and I couldn t sleep. The bathroom did not even have the most basic anti-slip mats. It is not recommended for children under three years of age to stay.

7677, Tesla dedicated to the situation where there is no space for a petrol car 
7681, Tesla M3

7722, VIP. There are still five parking spaces in 6 locations in the afternoon on ordinary days. Tesla is getting more and more difficult to have a location on holidays. It is recommended to install at least 10 parking spaces and even more than that. 
7725, In the VIP area on the 3rd floor there are 6 chargers which is a lot. However there are many people during dinner on the 6th. It is recommended to go out early to avoid being unable to charge when full. 
7727, There is also a place during the Chinese New Year 
7728, Next to the 3F VIP parking area you have to move the triangle by yourself 
7729, Managed very good

8241, The four charging positions are all occupied by petrol trucks and are not managed 
8246, There are four parking spaces which can be used for Tesla electric car charging but because all four spaces are parked by gasoline cars can Jianyi mall management strengthen the posting of signs so that gasoline car owners can understand.

8277, God-level parking lot charging bays and women' and children' bays are right at the entrance. There is also a special parking bay for heavy machinery. There is no triangle cone or ground ring but there is no gas truck to take up Saturday noon. It is very comfortable to park at noon. 
8280, Location is great

8288, Why is it so great? 
8289, Charging

8325, There are 4 charging seats and the parking space is quite large. You can see it when you turn right at the entrance. Free parking for pure trams. At the exit go to the manual toll road and register with the staff. The staff has a very good attitude.

8370, B3 Parking Lot A Zone 
8371, 220V / 48A 
8372, The parking spaces are small but there are many dedicated parking spaces. All regulated Teslas stopped (overnight?) 
8373, Charging free equipment is well managed 
8374, I went at eleven oclock in the morning and all eight seats were still there. While charging I took the red dragon pillars nearby and blocked two seats for the riders. I hope these pillars are not taken away by the administrators too soon. . 
8375, In the parking area of Zone A of B3 there are a total of 8 charging spaces. Currently the 4 on the left have triangular cones but the 4 on the right are open for refueling vehicles. The parking spaces are very narrow and the wide-body Tesla is parked in parallel. Be very careful when driving the door. 
8376, The control is well located in the corner of B3 
8377, If it says there is no seat you can use the walkie-talkie to notify the administrator and he will put the charging car in 
8378, There is a petrol truck parked in but it is generally well controlled. 
8380, Oil trucks are seriously occupied! The 72A is fast and the parking spaces are so small that people cannot get out after Model X parks in! 
8381, Eight of them are badly occupied by petrol trucks 
8382, Finally there is control 
8383, Although it is under control it is useless! Gasoline cars are often occupied! 
8384, Get up early to watch a movie thank the management office for helping to open B3 so early 
8385, After charging please put the traffic cone back to block it otherwise the car users and the on-site business test car will not be able to charge. The four controlled parking spaces are leased by Tesla to the pop-up store and the rest are far from being controlled.  
8386, The one fault on the far left 
8387, Charge successfully 
8390, The electric pile on the far right is suspected of not being overcharged (?) 
8391, All parking spaces are occupied by petrol cars overused

8483, Alhamdulillah the charger is working fine at 22kW 3phase! 
8484, The first MG ZS EV to arrive and charge here at Petronas Gambang Arah Timur 
8485, Power is available but the charger is dead. 
8486, The electricity supply often trips when there's a storm. If you get here and the EVSE does not respond ask a worker to switch it back on by flipping the switch which is inside the electricity supply room. There are 2 doors marked with the danger signs. The switch for the EVSE is inside the right hand side door on the wall just to the inside of the door. 
8487, This station owner switch off the charger. By any means please charge anywhere else. 
8488, Occupied by Gas Truck 
8491, A charge for parking a charge for an expensive one 
8493, It is reasonable to charge 7kw at 30 yuan an hour but you need to ask the parking manager to take the card to get the electricity and you need to press the certificate. Forget the trouble the parking room is often no one is there and the phone cannot get through. 
8494, Not yet in service. 
8496, 2 reserved plots parking fee (30/hr on weekdays) + charging fee (30/hr) are calculated separately. Only when you register at the management center you must register a certificate or deposit to help you swipe your card and overcharge. Come here to charge 
8497, You need to pay an additional 30 yuan per hour for charging. It is not cost-effective to use small batteries in petrol cars. 
8498, No management of oil truck occupancy 
8499, The hardware is set up and powered on but it is not yet open to use. There are 6-8 hosts on the right side of the B4 entrance 
8500, The charging method is too inconvenient. You must first open to the exit pay the deposit and have the documents to charge and give up directly at the entrance. 
8501, Occupied by petrol trucks and not managed 
8502, Unable to power up the service staff said it is still in the testing phase 
8503, Not only the parking fee but also an additional charging fee... and Its troublesome 
8504, I will visit again in a month and the equipment is on standby. However the management office said that it is still in the test and there is no expected opening date and will make another announcement. 
8505, Ok 
8506, In addition to the parking fee there is an additional charge for charging which is not worth coming. 
8508, An extra 30 yuan per hour cannot be discounted and the position is very small and will not be recharged 
8509, It is completely unregulated that all 8 charging parking spaces are occupied by petrol trucks 
8510, I do not know if there is electricity but it does not matter that there is no control at all so all charging parking spaces are occupied by petrol trucks. 
8511, 2017.10.20 call customer service the company currently has no plans to activate the charging stand. 
8512, Taking a break 
8513, Charge successfully but no shaded parking makes the car very hot 
8514, Was slower than 22 kW and hang up while charging...

8534, The business staff are very polite and are open to charge all electric vehicles
8535, Just ask the service staff to pass the card before leaving get off work and the attitude is kind 
8538, Its not bad to use but it seems that the battery will trip before it gets closer to 18-20A. 
8539, Free and easy to use 
8540, Good management 
8542, 6 parking spaces 4 charging piles (TPCx3 Type2x1)

I am lucky to have a seat to fill... (Noon on December 20 2017)

8953, In order to recharge I called the counter to confirm the day before staying here but there was a problem with the handover. The parking space was still occupied by the oil truck. The other only mechanical parking space. Tesla was too fat to stop at the door... I felt miserable. 
8954, Make sure to charge at the counter before making a reservation and stop and charge smoothly 
8955, Its very convenient to reserve accommodation and charge. 
8956, There is only one location. Remember to make an appointment first. It is safer. It is located in the disabled compartment of B2. The charger is closed in the wall. Please ask the hotel staff to open the cover. 
8957, In cooperation with the  Yancheng Parking Lot  diagonally opposite the accommodation can park and charge for free.  
8958, The hotel staff is kind and you can reserve a parking space. Because there is only one electric car for me that day I suggest that I use Volvo' J-1772 charging stand first which is closer to the wall and protects the car. The specification of J-1772 here is 220V / 32A. 
8960, Charging for hotel users only

A volvo j1772 charging device is newly installed next door and the cable is long enough to extend to the next car compartment (volvo j1772-32A/217v)  
8976, Charge and not borrow

9033, someone is parked there right now just saying 
9034, Damn it! Occupied by a petrol truck 
9035, Its all taken away by fuel vehicles 
9037, Unexpectedly it is not occupied and has a sense of ethics 
9044, The tram occupies a seat and does not charge 
9045, 24A is all I got. 
9046, works great. unfortunately 1 out of the two space available was ICE'd. 
9048, There are pyramids today there is no gas and the car is close to Ren'ai Road. I gave it to you. 
9049, B1 306 and 412 compartments face each other and there are traffic cones reserved. 
9050, You can swipe the card directly with the Youyou card you do not need to go to the management center to register the card. But Its best to talk to the administrator 
9052, Charging piles have been used to enter the venue be careful when you enter the venue as if there are no seats (the above shows that the remaining parking spaces are for heavy machines not for cars). You have to collect money to go in and go around for ten minutes and you cannot find a seat. I was charged 20 yuan and scammed the parking lot. 
9053, Parking spaces B1-412.306 have triangular cone control 
9054, Currently only 306 and 402 are not charging parking spaces.

9073, There are two grids 306/412 you need to start charging after the inductive leisure card 
9076, At B1 after going down drive to a parking space on the left and right at the end of the road. There is a traffic cone but it is not put back. The left side is occupied by a petrol truck! 
9077, It s selfish enough for the administrator to put the triangle cone and be removed by the owner of the petrol truck on his own. 
9079, Good 
9080, Good luck this time no gasoline car occupied the parking space! PS may be the charging system of BMW the amperage will be limited to 24A! Its a bit disappointing!

9104, When the audience is full there is no gas car occupancy smooth charging great 
9105, There is a courtesy from entering the parking lot. The parking space is  Tesla exclusive . Recently it has not been occupied by petrol trucks.

9153, Its a good place to put a triangle cone for control! I hope the giant city can also have a charging stand! 
9154, Good luck and position 
9156, When I arrived here to charge this morning the administrator was still very kindly guided but when I picked up the car in the afternoon I was told that future non-Tesla charging vehicles are not allowed to stop here for charging. The reason is that these three parking spaces are related to Tesla. The instructions given by who signed for cooperation are so imperfect and the attitude of the administrator in the morning and afternoon is polarized! 
9161, Fast charging 
9165, Finally... 
9167, The point not connected 
9168, From 0% SOC 
9169, Nice area to charge

10246, Its not a holiday. There are not many tourists. It is a good place for leisure and walks. Parking is $50 per time unlimited time. But the charging speed is very slow 32A 217V.

10355, Its all occupied by gas trucks 
10356, Successfully charged 
10357, Free stop for one hour 
10359, Its more convenient to charge here and there is shade 
10360, Its quite convenient to come here for recharging but unfortunately there is no parking space for rent. 
10361, It is often full of petrol trucks and I reacted to the security and I got the reply: When there are many holiday cars do not come to Taiwan to recharge. A bunch of black question marks... 
10364, Its built brand new and quite a call 
10365, Parking charges charging must first go to the service counter to borrow the activation card a membership card is required. 
10367, The one in the middle is faulty the ones on both sides are good 
10368, Looking forward to meeting red BMW i3 owners again 
10369, The charging was completed successfully. The administrator recommends not to come here to charge on holidays. Very strange argument
10370, It s normal to charge at 8 o clock in the morning. Now at 5:30 in the afternoon I can see the words  equipment maintenance  on the equipment. For a long time I feel that Tailuo does not welcome electric vehicles to charge here because they think it s electric. The car only comes to recharge and it does not cost money to consume. The entire mall has such a poor design of movement lines who wants to walk two hundred meters into the mall to go shopping when it s time to recharge. 
10371, At least one parking space will be reserved on holidays 
10372, Three charging piles have been deactivated 
10373, do not go if Its all worn out 
10374, Very inconvenient 
10376, Full 30kW 
10377, There are a lot of problems. There is no one to manage it. The location of the charging station is good but it is not blocked. So it is difficult to find the location overnight. Then I need to find the service center to start it. You cannot just use the leisure card to open it! Then there is only 32A! 
10378, I did not stand with Ben to fool people 
10379, Youyou card can be opened 
10380, A good place for shopping and eating while charging. 
10381, Free parking for an hour in the middle of the night is unavailable 
10382, This parking lot is not very friendly to electric vehicles. I came to charge on February 9th. The administrator removed all the triangular cones in front of me so that the petrol truck was full of these three spaces. I could only leave in anguish.  
10383, 2019 1206 can be charged normally 
10384, All three charging cradles have been cut off and cannot be used 
10385, Its already possible to charge this time. I use Yulon' card to directly swipe the card. It should be possible to use the leisure card as well. Try it next time. 
10386, A chance encounter with a madman' journal shooting 
10387, The charging pile in the parking lot No. 16 is broken 
10388, Three are broken and two are broken. Call 02 5592 0006. I cannot leave a message after the voice is changed. Who can fix it if it breaks 
10389, Went to charge at Cheonan Supercharger and it was gone! Drove around parking lot to see if it was moved. Did not t see any chargers at all. Luckily I had enough charge to get home. Just got V10 software yesterday and it has disappeared from the map too. (I had it as a favorite pin which is why I did not initially notice it missing. I hope that Tesla will add back another Supercharger somewhere in this central Korea area. It s a crossroads for many interstates and there isn t any other Superchargers in that area. Now it s kind of a dead zone. 
10390, Its rare not to be occupied by Tesla today 
10394, The manager is very serious and will take the initiative to remove the triangular cone great. 
10396, 116 position continues to fail 
10398, The management is great. It has a triangular cone and an electric license plate recognition system. The charging is normal. Today is Sunday and there is no gas car. 
10399, There is a ground lock. Very good 
10402, With the license plate recognition of electric vehicles the charging parking spaces can be given priority to enter the venue if they are available! You can charge with the leisure card  
10403, not bad 
10404, The environment is good and there is also a license plate recognition parking space system. You must first get the sensor card from the management office. 
10405, When the seats are full the guards will give priority to the tram when they see it. 
10406, Fortunately there is the last position all others are petrol trucks 
10407, It is very convenient to reserve parking spaces with triangle cones 
10408, Remember to calculate the charging time if you cannot receive the Taiwan Columbia signal from the charging parking space 
10409, No parking for non-electric vehicles is marked yes! 
10411, Two are available the other 4 are still being installed! 
10413, There is a triangular cone control not bad! 
10416, 64A 
10417, There are 3 Tesla charging pile parking bays first come first stop you need to pay attention to the neutral position. 
10419, Its hard to find a seat at the entrance of the ramp from B2 to B3 
10420, The control is very good just enter the parking lot B3 from E-Da Paradise and turn left and right. 
10422, 64A 217V on the B2 floor 
10423, Turn left on the slope and go straight to the end. There are 3 charging piles 48A on the left under control 
10425, Turn left on the slope and go straight to the end. There are 3 charging piles 48A on the left under control 
10426, There is traffic cone control 
10428, Was at 40km upon arrival from the HsinChu supercharger where we had dinner at the hotpot restaurant. 7 hours fully charge. Perfect! 
10429, There is control praise! 
10430, There are controls go to the hotel staff first and they will help you remove the triangle cones in advance. 
10431, Turn right on the slope into the b2 gate then turn left and go straight on the left side of the handicapped parking space the largest 64A 3 seats 
10432, Reservation is required. The car is located next to the water valve. Pay attention to parking. 
10435, Located at the corner of B1 entrance there is a triangular cone control it is very convenient for dining and accommodation near the elevator. 
10440, No one is grabbing a seat. When there are multiple cars the management will coordinate separately so there is no need to move the cars in a hurry. I saw someone responding to the occupancy of the oil trucks but there are currently triangular cones placed so the management should be improved a lot. 
10443, 40A which can charge 36 kilometers per hour which is pretty good! 
10445, Only Tesla' charging dock 
10446, 220V/16A charging 
10447, Please reserve a charging parking space at the counter 
10450, Nice new hotel?best crowne plaza I've seen. 
10451, Its not easy to control. There are many parking spaces but petrol trucks occupy charging seats and the hotel' own cars are also parked. 
10452, There are still three vacancies the hotel is properly managed and does not occupy 50% of the PHEV full battery and even the dummies are not charged to the pure electric car owner. 
10454, The parking space inside is a bit difficult to stop 
10456, 32A rechargeable stand can be reserved 
10457, Special charger for Tesla there are currently four rechargeable 
10458, 8KW 
10461, Attention the charging installation here is based on two circuits two parking spaces on the right one circuit and two on the left. If one circuit is charging two cars at the same time it will keep jumping! 
10465, Not free parking 20 hkd per hour only 2 charger 1 is broken 
10467, Machine is offline. So probably cannot charge 
10468, Not operational 
10469, Only 2 charging positions here 
10470, Two ChargeNow stations available on M Floor. It s currently free trial period (Nov 2018). Just inform the security guard and he will use his smart card to activate charging 
10473, No Type 2 
10474, Good 
10477, The security guards take good care of me but I am a little confused. At first I said that our car chargers are not the same. But when I go in and look again it can actually be charged but overall Its good. 
10478, It works normally. There is a guard to take care of. 
10479, I h 
10480, Not Available 
10481, The charger is power off still... 
10485, Please put the triangle back when you leave! 
10486, tesla works

10499, This one just does not work. The guard told me it has been out for some time now. Sad. Hope ChargeEV can sort this out. 
10508, Very unfriendly the factory staff expressed that they would not recharge the brand 
10509, Charging for private room 
10511, Facing the four charging piles the second one from the right is 64A and the others are 56A. You can charge the faster one first. 
10512, Eat watch a movie or go shopping and recharge by the way 
10513, Looks fast 
10515, CCS2*2 one of the charging parking spaces is occupied by Toyota SUVs 
10517, With management new parking can be installed 
10518, Very good management. 
10520, Only TPC no ccs2 
10522, The new CCS2 cannot be charged 
10523, 48 amps are indeed true! 
10524, Watching a movie charging is pretty fast it has 56A 
10525, Its here in b3 Its very convenient 
10526, The four stations in the TOC position are very crowded and I have to get out of the co-pilot 
10527, Thanks to Kaohsiung Dayuanbai the original 4 TPCs will remain unchanged and 2 new type2s will be added. 
10529, 2* type2 
10530, Good to find! After eating watching the movie! Its also full! 
10532, Facing the right side of the charging parking grid the charging head will not be able to absorb it loosely causing the charging speed to be slower. 
10533, The parking compartment is a bit small but it can be used normally 
10534, This is currently one of the best charging stations in Kaohsiung that has been carefully maintained. In addition to the 4 TPC specifications 2 additional TYPE2s have been added! 
10535, There is no space for a petrol car and the charging speed is good 
10536, The basement I saw it as soon as I came in

10849, One of the two electric piles is broken and both of them are occupied by oil trucks 
10851, The Hwaseong charger is not easy to use. Pay attention that the sensor position of the card is in front of the RFID lettering. Then do not stick the card to the machine otherwise it will not be sensed and it will take a little shake to succeed.

10912, 72a quick charge great 
10913, You have to tell the hotel staff before you turn on the power. The maximum power is 230V and the charge can be 52km/hr per hour. Non-guests can charge 200 yuan per time not 200 yuan per hour. However the parking space is a bit small and it is a bit crowded if all 3 cars are parked. There is also a charging station in the tin house 
10914, It is too expensive to provide only two hundred yuan for the use of guests and non-guests for one hour. 
10916, An administrator is watching.

10958, Convenient parking no card needed. 
10968, There are two sets of charging docks next to the exit management room. The administrator said that two cars cannot be charged at the same time otherwise the battery will jump. But you can plug in the power first and the administrator will assist in starting one after one is gone. Although the hardware is a bit problematic  But very well managed! 
10972, The management is very good as soon as the parking guardian comes to care 
10973, Unable to charge with Yoyo card you have to get the card from the administrator 
10975, Administrators usually turn off the power 
10976, Transfer in use 
10977, According to the latest news from the hotel one of the three TPCs has been changed to Type 2. So currently it is TPC x2 + Type 2 x1.

11001, Management says: no equipment 
11002, For the power of 35km/hr it is recommended to go to the Chi Mei Museum to charge quickly 
11003, I think it s a bit troublesome to join the membership for a long time. In addition to the basic information binding it also takes a long time to give up directly. 
11006, The parking lot keeper has a very good service attitude and helps to pay attention to the status of the tram space Its just that the parking here is easy to fill up and the petrol truck will directly stop the tram seat. 
11008, Perfect Management

11056, I went at 6 oclock in the afternoon. I tried two charging stations and it did not work. The car showed that the charging terminal was not powered. I asked the administrator and there was no way to deal with it... Then I went to National Taiwan University to charge it. Maybe it happened that there was no electricity today...

11277, Great charging point 40A 
11278, 48a 
11279, Next to the b4 elevator entrance; the parking space is very small and the car against the wall has to climb out of the co-driver; the charging free parking fee is 60/hour but the current consumption of 500 yuan can park for half an hour 1 000 yuan can park for free for 1 hour and happy go is available Add 1 hour 
11280, Two stations are CCS2 now 
11282, The parking space is quite narrow 
11283, Fang Bai can only stop by summoning 
11286, There is one type2 vacant space left but the car is too small to park. 
11287, If you do not call do not even think about getting off the parking space against the wall 
11289, 48A only me a car 
11290, There are two more frames 
11292, Very good there are 4 locations 
11295, Yes Its not occupied. But the parking space is a bit small. 
11296, Small space but satisfied 
11297, Small parking space 
11298, If you want to park at the nearest exit try to stay next to it so that car owners who come from behind have a little more space to park and get off. 
11299, What' the bad plan for super small parking spaces Half of doing things 
11300, B4 will only open after 12:00. The plan is pretty good! 
11301, My Secret Base 
11302, Managed guided by a dedicated person 
11303, The parking management office informed Tesla that no leased parking spaces will be controlled in the future 
11304, The parking spaces are really small and Tesla' cars are generally wide. On average 2-4 cars are in use during the day and night several parking spaces. If there is no call... it should be impossible to get off... If you want to climb the back car you can also climb the back seat if you park on both sides...
11306, The location is not ordinary small 
11307, The parking space is too small...you can only climb out of the co-driver 
11310, The location is really small thanks to EAP for allowing me unrestricted access. 
11312, Small 
11313, The location is too small. The two Teslas next to it do not know why they are parked very close to the tires. They are pressed on the line and parked. There is no way to open the door so it is a pity to give up charging. 
11315, The location is very small. If you stop four Teslas you need to be very careful when opening and closing the door and you need to practice your summoning skills when you enter and exit. 
11316, Perfect management. 
11319, Careful if park on spot closest to elevator if backed in driver cannot get out of the car. Wish I had FSD. Spaces are tight. 
11322, Ranking child 
11326, Its good to have a charging station although the location is small and crowded 
11329, Good management of fuel-free vehicle occupants who are skilled in guidelines 
11331, There is no J1772. Although there are four seats but the space is very small crammed into four the door should be opened carefully. 
11332, Very good one of the few chargers left that supports 72 amps charging parking spot a bit small need to reverse with care. 
11334, B4 64-67 
11337, 60 yuan per hour deductible for consumption and movie tickets 
11339, See a movie 
11340, Space close to elevator in B4 
11342, The parking space is well designed next to the elevator B4 
11344, After the response has been regulated the charging speed is fast 
11345, 48A 
11347, Three of the four Tesla charging parking spaces have been stopped and the other is malfunctioning and unable to provide charging. 
11353, On the side of the road. Nobody is needed. It can be used 24 hours a day. Thank you Ma Yilong. 
11355, Buddha heart! 
11356, Its relatively large only turn on the power supply and there is no response left by the door. This can only be used but after charging for a period of time the charging station will light up in red and then it will stop charging and it can only be recharged after plugging and unplugging it again. 
11358, It can be recharged the guard will also reserve a parking space and the service attitude is excellent 
11359, The two 40A roadsides are occupied by other cars but because they are in the most side position the row can still be charged. 
11360, Remember to turn off the electric box after use! 
11361, The guards have a good service attitude. The black rice bran milk tea is delicious. 
11362, Really touched 
11364, The first one cannot be charged the second one is OK 
11365, Oil trucks will still be occupied it is recommended to put a triangle cone 
11366, 0822 Charging failed 
11368, You need to charge it yourself there is a silver box behind it 
11369, The charging station is right next to the gate 
11370, Charge for 24 hours but you have to turn on the power at night. 
11373, Changhua people are still friendly
11375, The charging is normal 40A thanks to Zhongxing Gubao 
11377, Gubao personnel commanded to the charging station with a good attitude pushing  
11379, The one close to the door is available but it will be interrupted from time to time once for 10 minutes once for 40 minutes. The other one is completely unusable. It is not recommended that the battery is too tight to recharge here. 
11380, It s great to have Taiwan s Gubao. One remaining is normal and the other one is malfunctioning. 
11381, Awesome charging station 
11382, Guards assist in arranging parking 
11383, Although there is a petrol truck occupied the guard still charges me in one place. Awesome.
11385, Thank you Taiwan Gubao

11389, Very Buddha-inspired company Big push 
11392, Guards will reserve parking spaces good service 
11393, Normal charging use use the first charging stick near the door 
11394, charging 
11395, Under adjustment 
11396, The guards are very good help remove the parking barrier I turn on the electric box and turn on the non-fuse switch. 
11397, Only one of the second generation can be recharged sometimes it will be disconnected and the other generation seems to be faulty 
11398, The guard is very kind to help move the parking space! 
11399, The first one has been replaced with three generations and the 40A is very efficient. 
11400, Awesome and super friendly! 
11402, The administrator informed that the rest by the door can be used. After charging for 20 minutes the car told to stop charging. It was found that the charging device was faulty (fault code: red light flashing 5 times) and the circuit breaker can be used again after turning on the circuit breaker. 
11403, You need to turn on the electricity of the electric box by yourself. Today I found that the one near the door was abnormal and couldn' be charged. 
11404, The charging pile near the door is broken and Tesla should have no time to repair it 
11405, Passing by to charge buy biscuits and ice cream by the way 
11406, Before use there is a power switch next to it to be turned on and turn it off when it is used up 
11409, Free charge just go in and consume 
11410, 40A 2 seats have a triangular cone control. The circuit breaker must be opened before use. The management staff is very friendly and the park is also very suitable for children to visit and play. 
11411, A good place to recharge and rest 
11413, The parking space is slightly smaller and the parking space is reserved. 
11415, There is no power supply and cannot be charged. At present the reply is not provided to the outside world.

11434, It has been out of order for more than half a year! The city government environmental protection unit takes time and time to repair and issue packages... 
11435, Oil trucks occupy more space 
11436, Equipment is about to be removed without power connection 
11437, Four parking spaces occupied by four oil trucks are completely unmanaged 
11438, Occupied by a petrol truck you have to brush it back after charging it! 
11440, Explosion. 
11441, Unable to pass the card it has been a while... 
11442, It s useless if the management office does not care about the charging station or the response on this program. 
11443, It can be seen that it is under management but it is still occupied by petrol trucks. Of the four charging stations only two can be used and the other two are under maintenance. 
11447, Civil servants just do not believe that there is a problem with the charging pile! Post a notice asking you to recharge normally after charging but it just cannot be recharged and it cannot be repaid! 
11448, Failure unable to connect! 
11449, Please swipe back after charging otherwise the next car will be unusable! 
11452, Very troublesome and uneconomical charging 
11454, According to the customer service the parking fee is 1H/30 and the charge is 30 minutes/30. Separate billing! Please think twice if it is quite expensive 
11457, Its great you can recharge for lunch

11477, Electric vehicles have  Electric Vehicle Priority  parking spaces which are in the same passage as the bus parking area. The parking space is controlled by a triangular cone and there are also guards patrolling the scene. Asked whether it was necessary to register or leave information the guard said that he could remove the triangular pyramid and stop directly. Tesla charging station is 32A Model 3 LR can charge 50 kilometers per hour.

11568, Parking fee changed to 40/hr 
11569, Although it is written that the service will reach 1630 it can still be recharged after 1700. Although the scene is blocked by a triangular cone anyone can remove it without seeing the administrator. 
11570, Its really an impact that the dead A Liuzi did not come! Its obviously a holiday but there are spaces to stop! Its a small luck! XDD

11846, Occupied by Gas Truck

11849, Currently both charging positions are full 
11850, Good luck

11852, Good luck I am the third M3 that just happens to have a charger 
11856, Both are full 
11857, I tried a few more times. Youyou co-branded credit card does not work (probably related to the bad antenna of the co-branded card) and the pure Youyou card can be sensed about one centimeter away. When I came there was already a Model 3 charged and it was full.  
11858, Two Hwaseong chargers and three parking spaces are shared. When the time comes I will come to a Prius PHV when I leave. It is full of Hwaseong. This sensor card is really bad. Some people say not to stick too close. Shake it by two centimeters and it really succeeded. 
11859, No response when swiping card 
11860, You can swipe the Yoyo card and it must be aligned with the RFID wording 
11862, B1 is 80% faulty and it shows that the api return failed after enabling it several times. 
11863, Equipment update prepare to charge the rhythm 
11864, After coming hundreds of times I finally saw that there is a triangular pyramid management. As expected the Yoyo co-branded card is not valid. Pure Yoyo cards will work. It should be placed one centimeter away from the RFID wording on the panel not the area shown below. 
11870, To install the EValue app the app is poorly designed the process is complicated and it is difficult to use. Unlike other charging piles it can be charged directly or activated by induction with a leisure card. It is recommended to change to a Delta charging pile. 
11872, Full 12A is charging next door...

11918, I have stayed at the Sun Moon Millennium Hotel Shuntian Huanhui Hotel there are charging piles for free this time I came to live here what is the result? One hour per hour? Does the boss know that there is a super charging station next to it   Free  even if the overcharge starts to charge at one time it is only 9 yuan. This hotel once more than 10 yuan per hour is converted to 100 yuan per hour. It is still slow charging. Unless the head is broken it will be charged here. Useless restaurant. 
11919, 100 NT/hr is really too expensive

12568, 3 hours free for hotel guest $100 per hour !! Very expensive electricity 
12569, 36 kilometers per hour 3 hours free for guests

12582, Occupied by gasoline car 
12583, There is no management at all only luck 
12584, All petrol trucks are not regulated 
12585, Occupied by Gas Truck 
12586, It sucks to the extreme Its the same as it does not. The petrol truck is shamelessly parked for you for a long time and the store is not managed. Its just bad nothing else. 
12588, Always occupied by oil trucks 
12589, Sads are never unoccupied 
12590, All occupied by gasoline trucks 
12591, A pile of garbage occupied 
12592, 48A three trams another triangle cone 
12593, Early adapters 
12594, Make up the card! Last time I went to see another one that Costco was not under control so it was full of gas cars! Its so risky that I still have the charge. Its not advisable to not control this thing! 
12595, All are occupied by petrol trucks. If you encounter occupation please contact the costco management department to strengthen management! You can refer to Zhonghe Store' practice and place reminders in the car compartment! 
12597, After waiting for 30 minutes finally the bad guys are here! 
12598, It is still occupied not being managed and even the triangular pyramid is not set up 
12599, Rotten places that are completely unregulated Its better to tear them down instead of putting them out. 
12601, Occupied by Gas Truck 
12602, I just waited until the petrol truck came out and the other party was embarrassed and kept patting for thanks. 
12605, Dumbfounded and parked by a petrol truck 
12606, Now there are traffic cones for segmentation and there will be no occupancy by gas trucks. 
12608, Occupied by Gas Truck 
12609, Good luck Two oil trucks and two pulls 
12612, There are a lot of other parking spaces but there are 3 petrol cars in 4 compartments which is too exaggerated! Poor management. 
12617, 3/4 Spaces occupied by fossil fuel cars 
12619, I am very lucky and I am grateful that among the four Tesla charging parking spaces three petrol trucks left one Tesla parking space for me...! I feel that Costco is really not taking care of it! 
12620, The staff member who was blocked by the petrol truck said that there is no broadcasting system there is no way to deal with the scene and there is no way to see that the triangle cone is fully charged. It is good luck. 
12622, Originally there was no parking space and I was going to get off at b2 but I met a friendly car owner who knocked on my car window and told me to wait for him and he was leaving. 
12625, One is occupied 
12626, Occupied by Gas Truck 
12627, Very good not occupied by gas trucks 
12628, There is a gas truck occupying a place  
12629, No matter how many vacancies there are next to it petrol trucks still like to occupy them alas! 
12631, Always Occupied 
12632, Every time I go I am filled with gas trucks. I have left a message in the suggestion mailbox of Costco' Neihu store to request enhanced management. Tram owners are welcome to participate in this grand event. https://warehouses.costco.com.tw/contact_zh/contact.action 
12633, Fully occupied by gasoline trucks no control 
12634, Sweep a row of white lesbians! 
12636, 4 Teslas are fully stopped  
12638, No control at all 
12640, B1 
12641, Unfortunately there are still petrol trucks occupying it which is very good. 
12642, Neihu Costco is completely smashed and has no management and allows oil trucks to occupy and use. Unlike Beitou Costco there are triangles and people who patrol and persuade regularly. 
12643, We often pile up rubbish so we have to stop looking at luck 
12645, It may not be possible to find a vacant seat during peak hours / be walked by the petrol station 
12647, 362 that grid was occupied by a petrol truck 
12649, 48A was successfully charged but occasionally petrol cars ignored the priority of electric cars and parked directly

12652, Successfully in the last position lucky 
12653, 10kw nice 
12655, Pyramid Management 
12656, Full of being parked by a petrol truck 
12657, I have come four times and finally got a place 
12658, 6.1kw is not enough power 
12659, With triangular cones and no occupation it went smoothly. 
12660, Type2 x1. TPC x3 
12661, It is better to just remove it to 6kw and learn from Taichung store. 
12662, Gas truck occupies half of it is unregulated 
12663, 3/4 space occupied by gasoline car 
12664, Only Type2 is left to help old car owners QQ 
12665, Half and half chance of success 
12666, Two TPCs two CCS2 
12667, Two seats occupied by a petrol truck 
12668, When I left at 9:30 there was no one occupied; when I left at 11:00 it started to be occupied; there was no traffic cone. When I left I took a cart and put it in the middle of the parking space. 
12670, Arrive early to get a place 
12673, All become 28A 
12675, 4 Type 2 and 1 remaining 
12676, The charging pile was changed to unusable 
12677, Four oil trucks are fully occupied and have enough sex. 
12690, It can be used normally. If there is no line please contact the staff at 7-11. 
12691, AC charge the input power is about 7 amps. It works normally. 
12692, Charge normally 
12693, Plug in your own cable. can charge normally. 
12694, Bring your own cable you can plug it in. You do not have to touch the card. 
12697, Not yet open for service 
12711, Exclusive parking space is good for charging and parking 
12714, Although the parking space is very small it is excellent if the parking space is locked and reserved for electric vehicles to charge  
12715, 9kW/40A Happy Charging 
12716, The parking space is very small. It is recommended that you ask the counter for parking space No. 155 when you check in. This is relatively large so that ModelX can park. 
12717, Controlled 40a 
12718, There are 3 Tesla chargers 40A is very good a great choice to come to Kenting 
12719, The car is small XD 
12720, After parking a small key lock block will be used so that the small block of the parking space can be erected when going out to prevent the petrol truck from parking. When you come back you can park by laying the block flat. 
12721, The parking space is small! Be careful when parking. 
12722, Very friendly charging station even if the parking lot is full the hotel will help Tesla owners leave a parking space 
12723, There is control get the parking space key at the counter check out and return it 
12724, Underground parking 
12725, The 154 parking spaces do not have car locks and no corresponding charging piles. Other charging parking spaces have to go to the lobby counter to get the key to unlock but the parking space is just below the lane. If there is a car behind while waiting for the key it will be very troublesome. 
12726, Two of the three positions are occupied by petrol trucks. The guards took the initiative to leave one position with a triangular cone. Thank you very much. 
12729, The management is kind and there is no occupancy of gas trucks praise  
12732, Youyou card induction starts charging 
12733, One is occupied by a petrol truck...

12742, There is a traffic cone control oil vehicle occupancy you can call before you come to explain the needs of use you can reserve the parking space 02-87321451 (30km/hr) 
12746, Good attitude of service staff 
12748, No. 22 parking space cannot be charged 
12750, After a well-managed entrance turn right to the left hand side 
12751, Successfully charged  
12752, There is a parking space occupied by a petrol truck 
12754, Remember to inform the management before moving the triangle to avoid being scolded... What' the big deal?! 
12755, B1 No.22 
12758, The entrance to the fence does not turn well 
12759, Good management with traffic cones. No fuel car occupancy 
12761, Very good! There is a triangular cone control

12775, One is broken there are two 
12776, Youyou card cannot be sensed 
12779, Serious occupancy of petrol trucks during working hours 
12789, There was an empty seat next to me when I came 
12790, To install the EValue app the app is poorly designed the process is complicated and it is difficult to use. Unlike other charging piles it can be charged directly or activated by induction with a leisure card. It is recommended to change to a Delta charging pile. 
12792, Responds many times in 1999 and finally repaired another charging pile 
12795, Its different from the normal operation. You have to use the Yoyo card to sense before inserting the plug. 
12797, full 
12799, A charging pile is broken 
12800, I changed a new batch of Hwaseong charging piles even if I have to download the app the charging process is too stupid. I can only find the charging piles on the map. After I find the charging piles I have to scan the QR Code. I should just scan the QR Code directly. Come on... Then there is no 17KW written in the explanatory board and the same 7KW is charging. 
12802, There is a space next to it 
12805, Broken one please respond to repair in 1999 
12806, Neither charger can start 
12809, Good 
12810, Holidays will be occupied by petrol trucks 
12813, The exit is small. If you are driving a ModelX do not turn right after the front wheel leaves the exit. Be careful of scratches on the rear wheel frame. My rear wheel frame has been scratched. 
12814, Three charging piles one is faulty. There is a triangular cone management. The charging current is required to be set to 16A so the speed is halved. 
12820, Great home 
12825, good day 
12827, The charging environment is not very friendly and there are always petrol cars occupying parking spaces 
12828, Its still not fixed Its been half a year I need to react to it  
12830, There is a triangular cone on the left hand side of the entrance to block it. 
12833, 220V/ 80A 
12836, At B1 near the management room and the car exit 
12837, Main computer is being repaired 
12842, The quality of the administrator is very poor and I am afraid that the electric car will charge. 
12844, 49km/hr charging rate 
12846, B1 has 4 charging parking spaces B2 has 10 the maximum current is 32A you can charge by swiping the leisure card 
12847, Charge by swiping your card 
12848, There are two license plates that cannot be recognized. 144/143 B2 license plate recognition is not effective and there is no response to the intercom... 
12849, At present the automatic electric piles cannot be lowered. I asked the management staff and only said that it has not been accepted and cannot be processed  
12850, 4 positions 32A 6-7kw ground lock is effective 
12853, Two of the four seats on the ground floor are occupied 
12855, Occupied by fuel-free vehicles normal charging 
12856, Like a petrol truck 
12857, There are management likes 
12858, The location is relatively small and the electric ground lock has not been completed. The parking lot is empty but one is still occupied by the Toyota Altis shameless 
12859, I heard from the administrator that it seems that only Tesla can successfully charge other electric vehicles. License plate recognition is not easy to succeed. 
12860, Managed 
12861, Starting from today you can directly use the Yoyo card to turn on charging 
12863, The 205 parking space charger is suspected to require the administrator' card to charge 
12864, It seems that the parking lot operating company has replaced it and the administrator said that the parking lot has removed the card authentication equipment (I do not know what it has to do with the activation of the charging pile) so it is temporarily unable to charge. 
12866, Someone deliberately exchanged the charging plug with the charger 
12867, Serious occupation but fortunately the line is long enough 
12869, When I went there yesterday all the four seats were gas trucks but obviously there are a lot of parking spaces in B2 but the electricity is enough I can only touch my nose and go to B2 to squeeze with the gas trucks. 
12874, Sorry. Lunch last longer than expected. Hogging the station a bit longer 
12875, Be careful of ICEd. 
12879, 9A 
12880, The service staff has a good attitude you need to contact to reserve a parking space first 
12881, It takes three minutes to get off the interchange so I told the hotel staff to reserve a parking space. 
12882, There are 2 destinations in the hotel when you need to recharge the hotel you need to note that you need to use the charging scorpion 
12886, Rooms services restaurants and charging are all great. Notify the counter in advance that there will be parking spaces for charging. 
12887, You can call to reserve a parking space for charging

12917, The service staff is very kind 
12919, It does not seem to be an external charging station (other than Toyota) 
12920, Business is very friendly  
12923, Polite manner but no one can figure out how to wait for 15 minutes to find the card  
12924, 40A...canopy parking a good choice for accommodation

12938, 50 yuan on holidays and free on weekdays 
12939, Guests should ask the hotel to reserve a parking space 
12941, Although the charging parking space here has a triangular cone control it is impossible to determine whether it is a reserved parking space! On the contrary it looks like you can park in and charge as long as it is vacant... 
12943, I stayed for a few days and no other cars came in. The line is very long. In fact the parking spaces next to it are also available. On the first day there was a gas station and then there was a pyramid control. 
12947, There is a link it seems that a special card is required to activate 
12948, One seat is occupied by a petrol truck but fortunately the other is still usable 
12949, There are controls to reserve the charging station and it will not be occupied. You can make an appointment first when you make a reservation.

12975, There will be petrol trucks occupying parking spaces 
12976, Charging is fast! The charging position is at B4

13069, If you don t enter Karuizawa you will not be charged even if you enter the park to eat and consume the parking lot will drive people and the charging is not friendly. 
13070, Only for residents not for loan!

13490, At 06:30am there is no power on unable to charge

13502, Brand new charging station but the entrance is terribly narrow 
13503, The triangular cones will be moved and there should always be oil trucks occupying space. 
13508, The oil truck occupies a space... the entrance is small... or the S is too big 
13509, When the passenger is full ask the entrance staff to let you enter the charge. You must get the proximity card from the management room. The parking lot has a standing sign. 
13510, Management started. Like  
13511, The parking lot personnel are required to swipe the card. There is management and a notice is used to indicate that electric vehicles are restricted. The parking lot personnel are very enthusiastic and they will take the initiative to assist in the swipe card when they see the parking from the monitor. 
13512, Both grids are occupied by petrol trucks 
13514, The administrator will notify you that you can come to charge after the petrol truck is removed. I immediately stopped and thanked him for his hard work PS requires the administrator to swipe his card 
13515, The parking lot is full but the electric parking spaces are managed and you can enter and park immediately.

13572, The newly installed charging station requires a card. The administrator has not yet figured out how to use it. 
13575, Business is very good and there is no parking space every time I come 
13576, There was a call to inquire about the parking space and the management was very enthusiastic. The parking space is very narrow but Its fortunate that there is a call function for parking. 
13577, Normal use on the left 
13580, Come to wash the car the boss is super nice professional and real. Prius can come to charge. Unfortunately Tesla cannot charge.

13643, The hotel staff is very polite and kind and guests can charge for free. 
13644, Charging hot springs 
13645, We went to the bath house for an hour and a half to borrow the electricity. When we arrived the counter said that the manager' car was blocked. The counter called to the manager and told the customer that he was not there. The main point was still heard by us. If we did not borrow it we just said directly. Well 
13646, Currently (Jan 2019) free of charge. You simply need to check in via EA Anywhere app. There are 6 charging bays in the front parking lot of the hotel plus another 3 bays in the back lot 
13648, Up to download the app. but not up to Scan to charge  
13649, There is a charging point in the back too but the power supply is only 2kW very slow. 
13650, Charged for 2 hours but the light did not come on. It is recommended to check. 
13651, 32v but very often white Tesla ms parking does not take up space without charging and it will make it difficult for people to park. 
13653, not bad 
13654, B1 can be charged remember to get the card with the friendly aunt of the administrator 
13656, Get the card from the administrator and you can charge it! 
13658, There are triangle cones in the parking space so you have to borrow a card from the management room for charging which is great. 
13660, A good place to charge at night 
13661, All Occupied 
13662, Good 
13663, Two of the 11 priority parking spaces are reserved which is considered an improvement. 
13664, Only two grids are occupied and the occupied car is also posted by the management unit. The occupancy status is much better than the previous message. Thank you for the efforts of the management unit! 
13665, I have been here three times and each time more than six parking spaces are filled with gasoline cars. In the whole parking lot there are still 30 to 100 vacancies. Today even the entire parking lot is full of gasoline cars. There is only one parking space in ten. The triangular cone was also removed by a petrol truck and it was blind enough. 
13666, Thanks to the administrator for finally adding the triangular pyramid management now the seat is very empty great! 
13668, There is no management and it is often occupied by ICE. Everyone has to file a complaint in 1999 and fight for their own rights. 
13669, There are many parking spaces for charging but I happen to be lucky to have one. Almost all of them are occupied by petrol trucks. 
13671, The rare charge succeeded  
13672, Gas truck occupies 2 places  
13673, Oil trucks are often full and the management office will let it go. 
13674, Located on the B4 floor 
13675, I was completely blocked by a petrol truck and when he encountered a driver who was still in the car please ask him to change the parking space (I have parked in the grid) and he still looked resentful. 
13676, The ground lock and car number recognition has been installed but it has not been enabled in the current test. Go downstairs to B4 and pass the traffic cone go straight to the end turn left and then turn left you can see the charging parking space in front of the left. 
13678, A bit hard to find but a lot of charging 
13679, Unfortunately at eight oclock this evening all the charging spaces are occupied by petrol trucks. Although petrol trucks are all posted with a note that does not occupy seats it seems that it will take a long time to be truly effective. 
13680, The charging stations are all occupied by petrol trucks water... 
13682, Even if there is a triangular cone I can see that many petrol truck owners remove the triangular pyramid and park and ask the petrol truck owner. On the contrary they will be choked and violated. 
13683, Most of them are occupied by petrol trucks. Poor management 
13684, There are regulations but there are still shameless petrol cars occupying 
13686, There are 7 petrol trucks in ten parking spaces here 
13687, Occupied by gasoline trucks management is super bad 
13688, Management needs to be strengthened. The parking spaces are still occupied. Why is the management of North City worse than New Taipei City 
13689, Every time you come to 11 dedicated charging parking spaces they will be occupied and can only be parked on the right side of the disabled parking spaces. 
13691, In the two T chargers the other 8 parking spaces are occupied by petrol vehicles. 
13692, smoothly 
13693, There are a lot of charging seats but most of them are occupied by petrol trucks 
13694, Most of the charging parking spaces are occupied by petrol trucks 
13695, If there are more charging parking spaces petrol cars will be occupied and no ground is locked. Please help me put the triangle cones. 
13696, Poor management there are many charging parking spaces but almost all of them are occupied by petrol trucks! 
13697, All are occupied by gasoline cars there is no way to charge and no safety cones are placed. The management is very bad. 
13699, Its all occupied by petrol cars but I did not charge the battery and paid for the parking fee. This is a public parking lot. You can respond in 1999. 
13700, There are no instructions for parking spaces for electric vehicles. You can look at the floor plan before you can go around for a long time. At the charging station B4 you will see yellow pillars forcing you to turn right when you get down the lane. It s time for the charging station But many parking spaces are occupied by gasoline cars. It really depends on luck... I came to park today on weekdays. Even if there are more than 100 parking spaces when I come today it is big Most electric car parking spaces are still suspended. It is conceivable that the holidays are even more difficult... 
13701, A lot of charging stations all of them are petrol cars 
13702, I have been here three times and each time more than six parking spaces are filled with gasoline cars. In the whole parking lot there are still 30 to 100 vacancies. Today even the entire parking lot is full of gasoline cars. There is only one parking space in ten. The triangular cone was also removed by a petrol truck and it was blind enough. 
13703, Occupied by petrol trucks 
13704, There are no ground stalls only triangle cones and many people haven' put the triangle cones back  
13705, On the fourth floor underground it can be triggered by the leisure card 
13706, It took a big circle and found that 73-84 of B4 are charging parking spaces 
13707, A bunch of blind petrol truck owners have no ethics to occupy 
13709, I want to praise the nearest administrator. Every day this week I have seen the occupied petrol cars have stickers that prioritize the charging of the trams (near I live). Obviously it works because there are more and more vacancies for charging! Everyone is welcome! Come to join us (B4 near the exit) everyone s record of joining us should be an important feedback for the administrator s efforts. 
13711, I m using CP7 Block B. You can try other. Charger beside me is ICE by a BMW PHEV

13720, The charging parking space is past the parking lot at the entrance of B1 and gt; Handicapped parking spaces and gt; Women and children parking spaces are charging parking spaces No. 1013 1014. A petrol truck occupies one and fortunately there is another. It is not a triangular cone but a plastic roadblock. Remember to put it back later! 
13722, 112 113 114 115 
13723, There are four seats available at 7:00 in the morning 
13726, Occupied by a petrol truck fortunately there is still a seat 
13728, 32A 
13731, A model s a toyota parked in a parking space are not charging... 
13732, Smooth charging 
13733, There is management of the spine and a parking space is reserved 
13735, Electric car! The license plate cannot be recognized as rechargeable ask the service staff to activate it! 
13738, The seat is too small... 
13741, Its great to have a rechargeable toilet 
13742, The environment is clean and tidy although the parking spaces are too narrow and the speed is really slow but the parking fee is low and charging is free. 
13744, The height limit is 1.9 meters 
13747, There are vacancies and the seats are too small to fit in. I heard people say that the card reader of the charging station is strangely not able to start. It is recommended that it is safer to supercharge because this station is risky. 
13750, There is no gas truck to occupy the parking fee is cheap and the charging pile is pretty amazing but the car is too small so you need to use a call to park in. 
13752, The seat is really small! But I am still very grateful 
13754, The electric locomotive can directly enter the car area from the entrance of the locomotive after asking the administrator for charging and it will not occupy the car compartment. 
13755, 32A there are placed pyramids 
13756, The parking space is bright and tidy. The disadvantage is that the seats are too narrow. If you park two cars in parallel you will be a little worried... There is Tsingda Night Market nearby which is quite convenient:) 
13761, The parking environment here is really awesome all have attached lines. 
13762, The parking space is very small. It is recommended not to stop a large car such as a Porsche volvo model xs otherwise it will not be cost-effective to be caught by the next car. Four out of three are in use and the charger for the remaining parking space No. 46 is broken and one should be placed. The triangular cone indicates the fault so as to prevent everyone from wasting time to stop and discover that it is faulty. 
13764, Full just a rider left. Feeling shrimp 
13766, The charging pile in parking lot No. 57 will be powered off. 
13767, Good management and not occupied J1772 connector 
13768, The parking space is really small you have to pull over to park 
13769, The charging station is very new... but you must use a leisure card to start...

13775, Four charging piles are faulty and the parking spaces are clean and regulated 
13776, Please ask the big car to pull over? How can the parking space be so small? 
13778, Clean and good environment 
13784, Always the best parking lot 
13785, The environment is bright and clean. 
13786, The parking space is very small and it is difficult to park for Model 3. A large car does not pull over and the remaining parking space cannot get in at all! It is easy to scratch the car next to it if you park hard! There is no way to charge! It is safe to go to the fast charging station Too much! Then there is a huge handicapped parking space next to it which is really messy. 
13788, Very good parking lot!  
13789, Half an hour is charged at 10 yuan for four parking spaces and two with pendulum triangles. Almost every time you come you can charge them. 
13807, Workers occupied by gasoline trucks have been queued 
13808, Managed 
13809, I think Caesar' charging stand is very special! The first time it was plugged in it was 36A! The second time it was plugged in it ran to 48A! It feels very special! 
13810, It is recommended to call to reserve a seat 
13811, Its great. Someone will guide you. But the guest can only use it! Only two! It is recommended to make an appointment! 
13812, Reserved 
13813, Booking first will leave a parking space for charging  
13814, Good patrol parking space 
13815, Actually you can use the Tesla adapter to charge J1772 on the left but the right cannot be successfully charged for unknown reasons. 
13830, A great charging environment with 48A 
13831, The power has been reduced from the original 72A to 32A 
13833, Good management no one will occupy it indiscriminately. 
13834, No card needed. 
13835, Charging is very fast 48 but beware of a monthly rental Mercedes-Benz license plate number 7896 etc. parked next to the charging point and opened the door will blow you up. 
13837, It is managed by an administrator but it is 32A 
13839, First time here take pictures 
13841, LR can reach 48A which is great and the management is great. When someone parks the car they will confirm whether it is an electric car. 
13842, First come accompany someone to take the exam 
13845, If you have a manager you have to go to the management room on the second floor to change your card before you can charge. 
13847, Its all occupied by petrol trucks...lack of management 
13851, The administrator has a very bad attitude as if he owes him money and wants to fight. If you want to come to charge please be mentally prepared for the driver. 
13852, Charging vehicles: China Motors e-Veryca five-seater unable to charge smoothly for unknown reasons 
13853, I want to borrow a card 
13855, Dudu room is forty yuan an hour charge it to the management room to borrow the card riders please remember to put the triangular cone back and do not be lazy! Otherwise no one can charge fk if the gas truck is occupied. 
13856, There are still petrol cars occupying half of the charging position 
13857, The petrol truck occupies the charging parking space and cannot be charged. 
13858, Petrol cars are full praise and praise 
13859, All are occupied by petrol trucks you have to go to the 2nd floor to borrow a charging card for charging. 
13860, Passing card has no response 
13861, The parking space is OK the driving lane is small you need to go to the management room on the 2nd floor to borrow your card. The parking fee is 50 yuan/hour hourly and there is no daily limit. 
13863, Good 
13865, Only 3-Others are occupied by gasoline trucks-Borrow the card before entering the door / White card can not be used

13871, 7 locations are occupied by non-rechargeable vehicles... 
13873, The truck is full and the label is unclear and there is no telling what card to use 
13874, Seven positions three of which are occupied by petrol trucks. 
13878, Go to the management room to escort the certificate for the induction card 
13880, Rotten charging station because you have to go to the second floor and ask the staff to take the card to start the charging station wasting people' time 
13881, It s a bit troublesome to go to the second floor with a card that cannot be used with a Yoyo card. There are a few seats occupied by petrol cars but because there are many priority parking spaces for electric vehicles wouldn t it be better to use a card and just use an electronic lock? 
13882, Charged today. Working fine. 
13883, The charge bays are loctated on level four of the Yotel car park. Vehicle access is gained through Claymore Hill.  You will need an access card to proceed through the the boom gate. There is only one charger to share between two bays. The bays are well marked and have a security camera.  Lifts are convenietly located next to the charge bays. The lifts will take you to the Yotel level 2 reception or continue down to a Orchard Road level. A short stroll through air conditioned comfort and your amongst it. Within Yotel you will need an access card to move between floors however there is public access to level 10 for the restraunt and pool. There are restrooms located in the restraunt Pool side next to the Towels and level 2 right of the reception. Don't forget to say hello to Yoshi and Yolanda the hotel's resident robots.

13904, One failure one good 
13908, 3 charging piles but the parking space is too small 
13909, Go straight to the basement next to the hotel and drive to the innermost part of B3. This is a building that has been peeled. Therefore the driveway in the basement has a bad slope. You must drive slowly otherwise the front guard and the middle are easy to rub. The power was not turned on when I first arrived so I turned on the power directly from the electric box next to it. The parking space is small but I think very few people will come to charge because the WC packaging plastic sleeve of the device has not been removed PS. My MS No air suspension 
13910, There are three charging parking spaces which are managed and very convenient. The parking spaces are a bit small but the problem is not serious. They should not be full so there is still plenty of space. 
13913, The parking space is small if there is a car on the opposite side of the parking bay it is difficult to park in 
13915, The parking lot is well-managed and guided by the administrator. The two dedicated parking spaces in the basement are right next to the automatic doors for entering and exiting the hotel making it super convenient to carry luggage.

14125, Encountered full 
14126, Thank you riders for giving way 
14127, Its all parked by gasoline cars (this phenomenon is the same in every department store). Tesla charging in Kaohsiung is stupid and I don t want to think about what Taiwan is?! Stop buying this kind of rechargeable car I m also stupid. .

14134, Three charging parking spaces and two were parked by petrol trucks 
14135, The Lunar New Year holidays are not occupied only Tesla is charging 
14137, Excellent! Controlled 
14138, Occupied by a petrol truck the switchboard said that it has not cooperated with Tesla. These three parking spaces are shared by petrol trucks and trams. But they also transferred to the parking management office at the same time. They sent someone to see and then broadcasted the owner to move the car . 
14139, If there is a special vehicle parked you can go to the Taiwan special counter on the 1st floor to talk to them or make a phone call  
14140, 40A There is no control over the parking spaces of I12. It is very difficult to have a parking space. 
14141, Its really unkind. Its not good to even ask the administrator where he is. When I get to the parking space I see that it is full of petrol trucks. It is even more irritating. I will never come to Kaohsiung again. Changed the mayor' code to wipe the waste! 
14142, 3 seats are reserved for trams on weekdays and oil cars can also be used on holidays. 
14143, There is no control at all Its all occupied by gasoline trucks 
14144, B2 is exclusively for Tesla 
14145, There are two TPCs in three locations. General vehicles can also be parked for electric vehicles during holidays. So do not want to charge on holidays. I can only watch being parked and unable to charge. 
14146, The number is a bit too small compared to the total number of parking spaces but Its a pity 
14147, A petrol truck occupies a space 
14148, fine! 
14150, There are only three and no management very bad 
14151, do not post pictures of these three Teslas anymore. 
14152, B1 D Zone 308 309 
14154, Taite s own vehicle has been occupied for a long time and it will not be removed when it is full  10 times and 8 times cannot be recharged.

14161, Thank you Tesla! There are three charging parking spaces and triangle cones!

14164, Unable to charge

14168, Occupying oil trucks  
14169, Hanshin Department Store is really bad. 3 of the I11 districts are all occupied by petrol trucks. I went to the service center to respond. They even said that holidays are not regulated. Ask the supervisor to come out and wait for a long time to say that they are not in their seats. 
14170, B2 area D parking spaces 495-497 
14171, Zone I. 
14174, The Hanshin Arena opened its doors for less than half an hour and the three charging parking spaces were fully occupied by riders. It means why everyone went to the Arena so early and there was a white MX parked in the general parking space next to it. It looks like it should be too late like me.

14176, Occupied by petrol trucks on weekdays

15930, There is no special charging for Tesla. On the right side of the gate of the hotel is a special Porsche charger. 
15931, One of the charging piles is dedicated to the Baoshijie exhibition vehicle and other vehicles cannot be used. Therefore there are only two of the three charging stations for residents. Even if they are used they may be called to change parking spaces in the middle of the night. 
15938, To switch the connector the speed is super slow and the master is required to install a Tesla charger.

16048, J1772 is Delta s charging base and requires Delta s proximity card to activate 
16049, For someone who can charge up and stay here my heart is cold 
16051, Regardless of whether there is accommodation charge 100 yuan an hour! 
16052, You need a Delta Telecom card to use it. Not available at the hotel counter. 
16053, Regardless of whether the accommodation charges 100 per hour or not is this knocking Panzi or saying that I do not want others to use it?  
16054, The accommodation will charge for an hour and 100 plus the guard will go up again after stopping...I do not want to charge at all. The hotel as a whole also serves pop so I shouldn' come again... 
16055, Personally I suggest never to come to such a bad place! As everyone who drives an electric car is a fool or a fool? With such a rate and provided power I might as well use a fast charging station! I do not think so Is it true that the person who pays out the money is too much money or is a high-profile car owner? (Many high-profile car owners like to say  user pays ) 
16059, One parking space is reserved and the other is occupied by petrol trucks; Delta Charger. 
16064, Its too advanced. The new license plate recognition system is already operational so there is no longer a problem of occupancy of gas vehicles. 
16065, The administrator said it was full open for petrol trucks to park and it would take several days to stop! 
16066, better 
16067, Only two

16070, The parking space is full. After entering the venue it is no surprise that the charging station has stopped the petrol truck. 
16071, Charging bays are full there are too few public charging bays in Tianmu area

16162, The environment here is very good! It is better for car owners who want to come to the hotel to explain to the hotel staff that there is a need for charging when booking a room! PS here is a 32-amp charging station! 
16164, Good service

16171, The entrance of the two Tesla parking spaces is relatively narrow. X must be careful to enter. 
16172, There are three charging stations. It is recommended that you make an appointment when you make a reservation. The accommodation is of good quality and I recommend it to everyone. 
16173, The three parking spaces in front of the entrance of the underground parking lot have only two destination charging points. If there is consumption you can ask the hotel to help demagnetize the parking buckle. Everything is going well. Except for a petrol truck occupies a seat when you leave you are so angry. gas!

17866, Leave in 20 minutes 
17869, Charge me... to talk about national events: Taiwan s success in epidemic prevention should be attributed to the fact that the Korean army stopped the parade of gluttonous snakes and set a model for the common people! Taichung Biao s willingness to follow up is indeed a clear stream in the political and religious circles... 
17870, Its very convenient now you can stop for 2+0.5 hours for free 
17874, There are many charging places but it takes a long time to get in. The parking lot is very kind. 
17876, One of the parking spaces can only be charged by reversing the car. The restroom has to go to the food court. I am hungry after strolling around... 
17877, You can go shopping and recharge. It s very convenient. The space between overcharged parking bays is acceptable while slow charging is very small.

18926, The park is currently closed but the administrator is very kind to let me charge. 
18927, 11/5 15:15 The drizzle and drizzle have good eyesight for the administrator. As soon as they enter the parking lot they become aware of electric cars... and they are on standby and asked. After explaining the charging requirements turn on the power and start charging (2 charging piles) ) The one closest to the inside when reversing the wheels must be aligned on the concrete floor it will sink and hurt the chassis!

18981, Its the first time to come to Hualien to supercharge Taiwan Clay 
18988, Starbucks. 7-11 
18990, Nice n clean rest area 
18991, North of Hualien the next super charging station in Taipei halfway through the mountains of South Australia and across the snow-capped mountains. The return journey is better than the stop. Here are Starbucks coffee and the Unified 7-11 Superstore; if it is early enough it can be big. Eat the local delicacies of the local Heping Village. If you have more time you might as well visit the Taiwan Cement Heping Factory. Since a cement factory planned and built decades ago can achieve such results. The ore is transported by gravity by means of vertical shafts. Ships transporting finished cement products to all major ports in Taiwan consumes several times less energy than trucks or even train transportation. The coal ash from nearby thermal power plants can be used directly as raw materials for the process and carbon dioxide can also be absorbed by limestone. Maybe one day Hualien will be abandoned. The wastes no longer need to be transported across mountains and ridges to Yilan for incineration and then buried. Instead they can be directly processed by cement kilns in the same way as advanced foreign factories turning waste into renewable resources. The water quality in the harbor is crystal clear and corals and oceans can be seen. Gallbladder crabs etc. have been certified by the EU environmental protection port. The crawler transport in the factory is completely dust-free and it is a great surprise for those who are sensitive to dust. The commendable thing is that this is a cement plant planned and built a few years ago and future generations will not forget the previous People

20688, Its not very easy to find. Ask the hotel staff. We are passing by to recharge the battery. We are not residents of Monster Village. The service staff does not actively inform the location of the charging station until we actively ask. It seems that we do not really want us to charge.
